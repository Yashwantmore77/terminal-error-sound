# sounds/

Place your `error.mp3` file here.

This folder must contain `error.mp3` for the extension to work out of the box.

You can:
- Record or generate any sound and save it as `error.mp3`
- Use a free sound from sites like https://freesound.org (check the license)
- Use the `terminalErrorSound.customSoundPath` setting to point to a file anywhere on your system

Recommended: a short (0.5–2s), distinct sound. The classic "faaaa" buzzer sound works great!
